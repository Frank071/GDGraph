=head1 NAME

GD::Graph - Frequently asked questions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 I am drawing a bar chart, and the chart area is a lot smaller than the image. What is going on?

As of version 1.30, GD::Graph automatically corrects the width of the
plotting area of a chart if it needs to draw bars (i.e. for bars and
some mixed charts). This is necessary, because rounding errors cause
irregular gaps between or overlaps of bars if the bar is not an exact
integer number of pixels wide.  

If you want the old behaviour back, set the correct_with attribute to a
false value.


=head2 I have my data in some format that doesn't look at all like the array that I am supposed to give to GD::Graph's plot method.

Check out the GD::Graph::Data class. 


=head2 Where is the ActiveState ppm of GD::Graph?

Ask them. I have asked them, but didn't get an answer. I don't know what
to do to get it included in their set of ppms, and I really do not have
the time to keep asking them.


=head2 Do you have some example code for me?

The distribution has a large set of examples in it. If you don't have
the original distribution, please get it from CPAN (http://www.cpan.org/
or some local mirror). 


=head2 Will you support X or Y?

If you send me a patch that (in a decent manner) adds the functionality
to the latest version, I may very well add it for the next release. If
you don't send me a patch, but just a question, you will have to be
patient.
